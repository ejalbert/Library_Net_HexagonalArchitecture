# LibraryManagement.Application.Tests

Placeholder xUnit project intended to cover the ASP.NET Core host (`LibraryManagement.Application`). No test files exist yet.

## Next Steps

- Add tests that spin up `WebApplicationFactory` instances to verify module wiring (REST endpoints mapped, Blazor assets served, Mongo configuration bound).
- Cover host-level concerns such as health probes, middleware order, and configuration overrides.

## Commands

```bash
# Restore and run once tests exist
dotnet test
```

Update this README when concrete host scenarios are added.
